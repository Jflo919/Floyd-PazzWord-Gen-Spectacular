### Decription
This password generator app adds the following functionality to the given html, css, and js starter code:

* creates a series of five prompts, which are stored in variables, asking for user input to choose password character length, choose yes/no for uppercase, lowercase, numbers,       or special characters.
* prevents users from not chooising any of the options for their password
* pushes previously created arrays, each containing a specific character type, into a new array, based on user input.
* uses a for loop to randomly iterate through the new array and generate the desired password.

### Issues:

1. The user must leave the box empy and click "OK" or press "Enter" for their user input to count as 'no' for a specific prompt. So, if they type no or click "Cancel" in the prompt box, the application will not work.
